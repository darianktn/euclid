# euclid

This repository contains my educational project from the "Basic Layout" course from Skillbox.
This is the site of the construction company "Euclid".

This project is responsive for all devices and resolutions.
There is also used a third-party library "Swiper" to design the hero section.
There are tabs for switching content in one of the sections.
The other section is made in the form of an accordion for hiding content and revealing it by clicking on subheadings.
The are hover effectson the site.
